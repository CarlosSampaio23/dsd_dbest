# Database Team

## Organization

### Team Leader

- __Name__: Eduardo Queirós (Eduardo)
- __Github__: [code36u4r60](https://github.com/code36u4r60)

### Database Architect

- __Name__: Pedro Ferreira (Bill)
- __Github__: [pedrof98](https://github.com/pedrof98)

A database architect is a professional who designs and plans the structure of databases used by software applications and systems. They work with software engineers to determine the database requirements, select the appropriate database management systems, and ensure that the database design meets the business and technical requirements. Database architects also design the database security features and ensure that the database is scalable and efficient.

### Database Engineer

- __Name__: Kangjie Liu (Brioche)
- __Github__: [briocheKJ](https://github.com/briocheKJ)

Database engineer is a professional who creates, maintains, and optimizes databases for software applications and systems. They ensure that databases are secure, scalable, and meet the needs of the application or system. They work with other members of the development team to ensure that the database integrates seamlessly with the software system.

### Tester (Architecture Tester)

- __Name__: Carlos Sampaio (Carlos)
- __Github__: [CarlosSampaio23](https://github.com/CarlosSampaio23)

Responsible for validating the software architecture of the database and it's implementation

### Tester (Infrastructure Tester)

- __Name__: Wei Zhoujun (Maxwell)
- __Github__: []()

A Database Infrastructure Tester tests the hardware, network, and storage systems supporting the database to optimize its performance, availability, and scalability.

### Database Developers

- __Name__: 李振河 (Still)
- __Github__: []()

- __Name__: Shiyu Wang (Watson)  
- __Github__: []()

A database developer is a professional who designs, implements, and maintains databases used by software applications and systems.

## Functional Requirements

- __Data storage__: The database should be able to store data in an organized and structured manner
- __Data retrieval__: The database should be able to retrieve data based on specific criteria
- __Data manipulation__: The database should be able to modify data as required
- __Data security__: The database should have robust security measures in place to protect data from unauthorized access
- __Data integrity__: The database should maintain the integrity of the data, ensuring that it is accurate and consistent
- __Data backup and recovery__: The database should have a backup and recovery mechanism in place to protect against data loss
- __Performance__: The database should be optimized for performance, ensuring that it can handle large amounts of data and respond quickly to queries
- __Scalability__: The database should be able to scale as the amount of data grows
- __Reporting and analysis__: The database should be able to generate reports and provide data analysis functionality

## Non-functional requirements

- __Availability__: A database should be highly available and reliable, with minimal downtime or system failures
- __Usability__: A database should be user-friendly and intuitive, with easy-to-use interfaces and clear documentation
- __Maintainability__: A database should be easy to maintain and update, with clear documentation and well-defined maintenance procedures
- __Interoperability__: A database should be able to work seamlessly with other software and hardware systems, and support common standards and protocols
- __Portability__: A database should be designed to be portable across different platforms and environments, with minimal customization or configuration required

> Performance, Scalability, Usability and Security are not clearly defined as functional or non-functional.
> We must validate this information.

### Week 1:

#### What has been done:

- Creation of teams 
- Distribution of tasks among teams
- First official team meeting
    - Brief presentation of each team member
    - Definition of each team member's role
    - Contextualization of the current state of the project
    - Discussion of next steps in the following week
    
#### Next goals:

##### Common Tasks (all members):

- Learn or review what is a database with particular focus on PostgreSQL


##### Bill (Database Architect):

- [ ] Learn how to devise a database project  
    - Data normalization
    - R-E model    
- [ ] Speak with Server Team to find what kind of data is required to store 
- [ ] Design the R-E model 
- [ ] Support the creation of 2 databases (Production & Testing)
    

##### Brioche (Database Engineer):

- [ ] Learn about database infrastructure
- [ ] Speak with Server Team to understand:
    - Data volume (size) required
    - Data traffic (per second) required
- [ ] Learn/review Docker
- [ ] Support the creation of 2 databases (Production & Testing)
    
> To avoid misunderstandings, Bill and Brioche are advised to talk before speaking with the Server team, 
> in order to decide what to ask of them (without forgetting fundamental information)

##### Carlos (Architecture Tester):

    - Data normalization
    - R-E model
- [ ] Help Bill define the database requirements
- [ ] Review the R-E model
- [ ] Define a strategy to test the database

##### Maxwell (Infrastructure Tester):
